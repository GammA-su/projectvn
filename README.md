# ProjectVN
A web engine for visual novel.


Using p5.js engine and javascript, I am coding a template/engine which will be used to create visual novel on the web.

SETUP :

You need to run a local server in order to run the vn. 
One easy way to do it is to install : https://github.com/greggman/servez

Then, git clone/download and extract, select the folder in servez and click run.
